IRCSharp
========
IRCSharp is a modular IRC robot. Through a simple contract it is possible to extend the robot  with new commands, at runtime without rebooting.

Quickstart
----------
See [Qucikstart guide](https://bitbucket.org/msl0t/ircsharp/wiki/Home).

Known bugs
----------
This is an alpha release. So there is many UNKNOWN bugs. Be aware that this bot does not yet handle:

+ Netsplits
+ Mass querying the bot (and flooding the channel)

Tested
------
I have written some unit tests to support the two parsers. I have only tests the minimum required so I can get the bot up and running. If bugs is detected, let me know and I will patch the bot and update the tests.
The bot is only tested on Quakenet.
